# README 

This repository contains R scripts for the analysis of ratiometric, pHLuorin2 based pH measurements in yeast cells.

### Dependensies
Under MacOSX make sure the latest version of [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/) is installed. The XQuartz/ X windows system is needed to get interactive input from the user via the tcltk library.

### calibrate.R
For the generation of a pH calibration curve from cells that were treated with monensin, nigericin and 2-deoxyglucose in buffers of pH 4.5-8.0 to adjust outside and inside pH.

### calc-pH_time.R
To analyse a time series of pHmeasurements. Please set all the parameters in the set parameters section correctly.
